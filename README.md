## 1. Deploy on Replit
- In your browswer, open the following link in a new tab:  
`https://replit.com/@myron0220/SpringbootVueMS#.replit`  
Then click the "Run" button in Replit.  

- Don't close previous tab, open the following link in a new tab:  
`https://replit.com/@myron0220/SpringbootVueMS-1#.replit`  
Then click the "Run" button in Replit.  

- Don't close previous tab, open the following link in a new tab:  
`https://springbootvuems.myron0220.repl.co/`  
This page is the main (ONLY) UI for the website.

## 2. Usage
- For CRUD usages, explore the website by yourself.  
(Note due to the time limie, "import" and "export" buttons haven't been activated. Sorry.)  

- For the additional feature (the "When deleting, allow deletion comments and undeletion" is choosen)  
When deleting a row, the deletion comment dialog will be automatically popped up. You can choose to leave your comment for that deletion.  
Use the "Show Deleted" switch to show previously deleted items. Then you can use "restore" to undelete that item.

## 3. Appendix
- The database is run separetely on Google clound, as Replit's terminal seems to response lagly.
